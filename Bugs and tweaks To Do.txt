Check cart.php logic regarding cart status

This is a quick recap of what I will do 
create-stripe-session.php will see the data exists and recalculate totals, then, 
open stripe,it will only receive the total and email. 

Once the credit card data is correctly written and stripe redirects back, 
I'll save the needed data in checkout_sessions in the database, make cart innactive 
and wait for the webhook. 

If the webhook success response is instant, 
store real order in the database, 
show a version of success.php that says the order details, make cart vanish
if it isn't instant, show processing order.

after upload modify addresses of stripe success
