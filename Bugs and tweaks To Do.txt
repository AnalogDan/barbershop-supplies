Check cart.php logic regarding cart status

This is a quick recap of what I will do 
create-stripe-session.php will see the data exists and recalculate totals, then, 
open stripe,it will only receive the total and email. 

Once the credit card data is correctly written and stripe redirects back, 
I'll save the needed data in checkout_sessions in the database, make cart innactive 
and wait for the webhook. 

If the webhook success response is instant, 
store real order in the database, 
show a version of success.php that says the order details, make cart vanish
if it isn't instant, show processing order.

After getting the delivery right:
insert delivery_eta when creating order in finalize-order.php
insert in table addresses the correct address in finalize-order.php
put the correct $addressId in finalize-order.php (when creating order)

After going live:
Modify public key in 2 places and secret key in 1 place
Modify addresses of stripe success
Modify webhook destination
Modify in stripe-webhook.php $endpointSecret
